mouse stuff:


every mousemove and mousedown, 
w.logMXY will log the current mouse coords
it works by recieving stage coordinates
and converting them to world coordinates
and it stores those values on w.mx and w.my
(p = w.sToW(e.X, e.Y); w.mx = p.x;  w.my = p.y)
so this just happens


w.i.c is a jquery canvas 
we can call mousedown on it.. which is the actual jquery function
but we will make a new event object (attachig original to property e)
this new one will be...  o = {x: w.mx, y: w.my, X: e.clientX, Y: e.clientY, e: e}
though... i think it unnecessary to attch mx/my to it.. because that can be fetched easily
anyway, we then do a ptQuery on the world with w.mx and w.my.. so it doesnt even need that event ob
this should return top fixture
if it finds a fixture, we attach fixture and body also to the event ob:
	o.f = f; o.b = f.B()
then finally we can run whatever function we passed in, and it will get the event ob



the world keeps track of one mouse joint
every mouseup nullifies it, if it exists
it is stored on w.mj

on mousedown, it may be created via w.mJ

we can make a mouse joint with w.mJ and we only need to pass it a body and world x and y
so of course we make it the current mouse coords
